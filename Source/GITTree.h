/*!
 * This class represents \e Tree objects in a git repository.
 *
 * Tree objects store the file system structure of a repository at the
 * point at which the tree is created. They represent directories or
 * folders and contain references to items in the directory/folder which
 * may be other trees, directory/folder, or blobs, files.
 *
 * Tree objects store a list of directory items with their associated
 * modes and SHA1 references. The SHA1 references are in the packed form.
