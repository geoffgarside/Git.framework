Git.framework - Mac OS X GIT Repository Framework
===================================================
An implementation of Git in Objective-C & Foundation framework for embedding in Mac OS X and potentially iPhone OS Applications.

Supported Features
-------------------
The currently supported features of the project are

  * Reading objects, both loose and packed
  * Resolving refs from `.git/refs`
  * Reading branches, both local and remote
  * Enumeration of commits in breadth and depth first orders
  * Rev-list Support to a certain degree, full compatibility with `git rev-list` is not yet available
  * Preliminary PACK File and Index generation support (API needs work, deltas currently unsupported)

Planned Features
-----------------
Features which will be implemented at some point (in no particular order)

  * Pulling changes from a remote repository via either ssh:// or git://
  * Pushing changes to a remote repository via ssh://
  * Mutable objects to enable writing new objects to the repository
  * Manipulation of the Index/Stage
  * ... and much much more\*

Additionally features from [CocoaGit][cocoagit] which are not yet supported will be evaluated and migrated into this project.

\*maybe, as and when things are thought of, suggested, or otherwise materialize, terms and conditions may apply, see binary for details

Adding the Framework to your Mac OS X Application
--------------------------------------------------
The first step to this is compiling a *Release* build of Git.framework, this can either be done in Xcode or via `rake` on the command line as

    $ rake build:release

the built product will be in the `builds/Release/` directory.

### Installing in your project
  * In the Finder, copy `Git.framework` to your project directory (eg MyProject/Frameworks)
  * Add the `Frameworks/Git.framework` to your *Linked Frameworks* group in Xcode
  * Open *Get Info* on your Application Target, select the *Build* tab
  * Change the *Configuration* to `All Configurations`
  * Enter `Runpath Search Paths` into the *Filter* field
  * Add `@executable_path/../Frameworks` to the *Runpath Search Paths*
  * Add a `New Copy Files Build Phase` to your Application Target
  * Select `Frameworks` from the *Destination* dropdown
  * Drag `Git.framework` from *Linked Frameworks* to your new *Copy Files* build phase

You might want to rename the *Copy Files* build phase to *Copy Frameworks*

Building in Xcode and Info.plist Versioning
--------------------------------------------
Some issues have been reported when building the framework in Xcode and the Info.plist Version script failing to find `git`. The source of this issue stems from how Xcode is started. If Xcode is started from a Terminal session via `open Git.xcodeproj` or similar then Xcode will inherit the `PATH` of the Terminal session. In the majority of cases this is results in no issues.

When Xcode is started from Finder then it inherits the `PATH` from the environment, which unfortunately is not the same as the `PATH` used by shells in Terminal. To change the environment `PATH` requires creating or modifying `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` with the Property List Editor and adding/editing the `PATH` key in the plist.

As an example my `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` looks like this when passed to `cat`

    {
      PATH = "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/geoffgarside/bin";
    }

After creating or modifying this file you will unfortunately have to login/logout for it to be picked up.

Thanks to Brian Chapados who did the detective work on finding this information out.

Running the Test Suite
-----------------------
The test suite requires [MacRuby 0.5][macruby] and [Bacon][bacon] and can be run either through Xcode or `rake` in the Terminal. So far tests have been run using MacRuby r3090 and Bacon v0.9.

Bacon can be installed either using Rubygems or alternatively with [rip][rip]

Code Formatting and Style
--------------------------
I've tried to keep the code formatting and style unified within the project and with the current body of code this should be reasonably easy to follow. To aid in keeping the tabs/spaces under control there is a pre-commit hook which can be installed via

    $ rake check_tabs:install_hook

if you don't have a pre-commit hook already then this one will be installed, if you do then the script contents will be printed and you will need to merge them manually. This will cause a commit were there are tabs in the files being committed to fail. If you want to check the staged files or `Source/` contents for tabs you can use either of the following

    $ rake check_tabs:source
    $ rake check_tabs:staged

and any offending lines will be printed.

The hook can be configured to ignore specific file MIME types and extensions, this is done as follows

    $ git config pre-commit.ignored.mime 'image/ application/xml application/octet-stream'
    $ git config pre-commit.ignored.extensions 'graffle pbxproj'

BridgeSupport
--------------
The addition of any C level constants which need to be exposed to a bridged language such as [MacRuby][macruby] or PyObjC will require the regeneration of the BridgeSupport files. The headers containing the constants or functions to be exposed will need to be marked as public in the `Git` target and then the `bridgesupport:generate` rake task will need to be run.

Documentation of Code
----------------------
All headers need to be documented using the style currently in use. Documentation is generated using the [Doyxgen][doxygen] tool and is then post-processed by the `Documentation/doxyclean` project into the final format.
